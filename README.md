# GENR_of_L1GPS_CA_code
Based on the information available in Interface Specifications (IS) of GPS, and the logic behind generation of Coarse Acquisition (CA) codes also called as Pseudo Random Number/ Noise (PRN) code a simple Matlab code has been written to generate the CA codes based on the Satellite/ Space Vehicle (SV) ID number.
The generated CA codes auto correlation and cross correlation properties were also tested.
